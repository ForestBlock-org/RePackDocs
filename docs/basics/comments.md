# Comments
Comments can be used anywhere in RePack files to provide additional help or information. They are ignored by the
RePack compiler entirely. Syntax:
```rs
def something = "some text" // this is a single line comment and provides some info

/*
this is a multiline comment.
a lot of text can be put in here,
to explain some template or something else in great detail.
*/
```
